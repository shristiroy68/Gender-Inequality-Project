# Gender-Inequality-Project
Man and woman both are equal and play a paramount role in the creation and 
development of their families in particular and the society in general. Indeed, the struggle 
for equality has been one of the major concerns of the women's movement all over the 
world. Gender inequality is, therefore, a form of inequality that is distinct from other forms 
of socioeconomic inequalities. Gender inequality in India is a crucial reality.
India has fallen 28 spots to rank 140th among 156 countries on the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap index. In 2020, India had ranked 112th among 153 countries on the index. The literacy rate in the country is 74.04%, 82.14% for males, and 65.46% for females.
The gender pay gap in India refers to the difference in earnings between women and 
men in the paid employment and labor market. According to a report by TeamLease, more 
than 72% of women feel gender discrimination is still prevalent in the workplace. At 53 
percentage points, India has one of the worst gender gaps (difference between the sexes) 
in the world when it comes to labor force participation a recent World Economic Forum 
report that only 14.3% of science researchers in India are women data from the National 
Sample Survey Organisation shows that the percentage of women working in finance, 
insurance, real estate, and business services, which includes information technology 
services, is only 13.4% across rural and urban populations. The report also said that the 
estimated earned income of women in India was one-fifth of men's, which put India among 
the bottom 10 countries globally on that indicator
